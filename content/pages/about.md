I'm a hobbyist from Finland. I'm interested in programming and computers in general. I started coding in Python, and I've been coding in C for about 4 years.
I like to experiment with different tools, languages, devices, etc.

What stuff I use(little bit TODO):
 - OS: OpenSuse Tumbleweed
 - Terminal: Konsole
 - Editor: VSCode

My PC specs:
 - MOBO: Gigabyte Z490M
 - CPU: Intel Core i7-10700KF
 - RAM: HyperX Predator 16GB DDR4 3200Mhz
 - GPU: Gigabyte Radeon RX 7600
 - Storage: 512TB Intel 660p NVMe SSD, 2TB Toshiba P300 HDD
